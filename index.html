            this machine is a type of amusement ride that employs a form of elevated railroad track designed with tight turns, steep slopes, and sometimes inversions.
                 People ride along the track in open cars, and the rides are often found in amusement parks and theme parks around the world.the track in a coaster design does not necessarily have to be a complete circuit, as shuttle roller coasters demonstrate.
                 Most roller coaster have multiple cars in which passengers sit and are restrained.Two or more cars  hooked together are called a train.Some roller coaster, notably Wild Mouse Roller coaster, run with single car.

            A variety of mechanisms protect riders on RC One of these is the block system.In this system, the track is divided into two or more sections known as blocks.Only one train is permitted in each block at any given time.There is a section of track at the end of each block where a train can be stopped if necessary,
                 such as preventing dispatch from the station, stopping a lift, or simply applying brakes.Sensors detect when a train passes so that the system´s computer is aware of which blocks are occupied. If a train attempts to enter an occupied block, the stopping mechanisms in al blocks are engaged.
                 Another key to safety is the programmable logic controller (PLC), an integral component of a roller coast3er´s computer system.Multiple PLC´s work together to detect faults associated with operation and automate decisions to engage various elements.

            There are several explanations of the name RC. It is said to have orginated from an early American design where slides or ramps were fitted with rollers over which a sled would coast. This design was abandoned in favor of fitting the wheels to the sled or other vehicles, but the named endured.
                  Another explanation is that it originated from a ride located in a roller skating rink in Haverhill, Massachusetts in 1887. a Toboggan-like sled was raised to the top of a track which consisted of hundreds of rollers.This Roller Toboggan then took off down getnly rolling hills to the floor. The inventors of this ride, Stephen E. Jackman and Byron B. Floyd, clam that they were the first to use the term RC.
