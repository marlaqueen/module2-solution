                 People ride along the track in open cars, and the rides are often found in amusement parks and theme parks around the world.the track in a coaster design does not necessarily have to be a complete circuit, as shuttle roller coasters demonstrate.

           There are several explanations of the name RC. It is said to have orginated from an early American design where slides or ramps were fitted with rollers over which a sled would coast. 
           Another explanation is that it originated from a ride located in a roller skating rink in Haverhill, Massachusetts in 1887.
